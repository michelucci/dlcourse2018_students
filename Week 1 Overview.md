Hallo Everyone,
it was a real pleasure to meet you all. It is great to have so many well prepared students at the course. 

Here is an overview of the material we covered, so that the you and the students that were not there can review it in their/your own time.

- An overview of how github works (if you are interested I uploaded a wonderful book in PDF on github in the folder "github Book")
- An overview of how Anaconda works (lots of information here in the official documentation https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/getting-started.html)
- An overview of lists in Python and how they behave (https://developers.google.com/edu/python/lists)
- The basic concepts of vectors, vector operations (scalar product), matrices, matrix transpose, matrix multiplication
- The basic idea behind numpy and how its arrays behave differently from plan Python lists (http://cs231n.github.io/python-numpy-tutorial/)
- An overview of matrix and vector operations in Python and numpy
- A demonstration of how numpy is much more efficient than plan Python lists
- A basic introduction to matplotlib (you can check this for example https://www.python-course.eu/matplotlib.php)

All the matrial can be found in the github repository as usual. I am working on week 2 and as soon as it will be ready I will send you an email. Target is by end of the week.
As discuss today try to do the linear regression problems at the end of jupyter notebook "Week 1 - Linear Algebra and Python Introduction" and let me know how it goes. If you have problems feel free to get in touch with me.

Additionally you can check the documentation to pandas https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/tutorials.html  that is full of tutorials and is really really helpful.

I hope you found this introductory lecture useful. 

Next week we will look at a bit of calculus and the gradient descent algorithm, and we will build a classifier together to perform binary classification simply looking at the data. We will classify images without even building a model to learn how important is to look at data. 

I wish you a nice week and see you next Tuesday!

Best, Umberto
